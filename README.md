The AI
======
The computer AI has 3 difficulty settings
* easy
* intermediate
* hard

On easy the AI will randomly select from open spaces, and on hard it will use a priority queue to choose the move that is most optimal. Intermediate randomly chooses between making a smart move or a random move.


Winning
=======
Winning is done by getting N cells in a row, with N being the length of the grid. (ie in a 3x3 grid N =3)
